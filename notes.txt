(Hopefully) Faster algorithm:

- Utilizes the fact that the cards are already sorted in the hand
  (starting from lowest to highest rank, spades to clubs)
- The functions either:
  - Tries to build a sequence from the current card
  OR
  - Tries to build n-of-a-kind with the current card
- Each time the function is called, it should do a second,
  recursive call to itself to try test the n-of-a-kind route.
  The current call of the function continues exploring the
  sequence route.
- Each time the function completes a combo it should do a
  recursive call to start a new combo. The current call of
  the function should continue exploring the longest possible
  combo.
- Also possibly keep an array of cards with same sign to check
  for n-of-a-kind combos. To exhaust all possible variants, use
  wrapping method when iterating (if you have an array of 4 cards
  , try 0 1 2, 1 2 3, 2 3 0, 3 0 1).
